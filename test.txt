Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer watched in his flat. Chancellor Rachel Reeves saw it in her study. The Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds, accompanied by staff and pizza, took in President Donald Trump's big tariffs reveal on Wednesday from his office in Old Admiralty Arch, from where the British Navy was directed to protect and control trade on the high seas in days gone by.

Ministers can only dream of having that kind of power now, as the UK watches on in growing horror at the bust-up between the US and China.

"Sometimes people don't realise they are living through a moment of history," a cabinet minister notes, as Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping square up to each other, and stock markets plunge. Trump has slapped a 10% tariff on all nations – including the UK – for imports into the US, and much higher rates on some countries, including China, which has responded with fresh tariffs of its own.

So what's happening in Whitehall right now to try to limit the harm to the UK, perhaps by making a deal with the US, and make the most of any opportunities?

Tariffs have shaken the markets - how worried should we be?

China and US are at each other's throats on tariffs, and neither is backing down

The PM is spending another dramatic weekend working the phones from the peace of his country pad, Chequers. So far, the other calls that could really matter, from US negotiators, have not yet resumed.

Trump dangled a possible trade deal that might exempt the UK from some of the costs from tariffs during the pair's chummy White House press conference in February. There have been significant negotiations since then by a team of around 20, led out of No 10 by Michael Ellam, the Treasury and banking veteran, and the PM's business adviser Varun Chandra alongside the business secretary.

Those talks included ideas about the UK watering down rules on electric vehicles, possible changes to a tax on tech companies ("space to talk about it", one minister says) and changes to online safety rules ("not happening", says a government source). ;
The son of a British couple who were detained by the Taliban nine weeks ago is calling on the US to help secure their release from an Afghan prison.

Peter Reynolds, 79, and wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in the central Bamiyan province.

Their son Jonathan called on the White House to intervene after Faye Hall, an American who was detained alongside them, was released last week by the Taliban, which returned to power in Afghanistan in 2021.

He told BBC News the detention of his parents - who have lived in Afghanistan for 18 years and ran education projects - had been "harrowing and exhausting" for their family.

Mr Reynolds said: "Anybody who has the ability to unlock that key and let them out, whether it be the Taliban, whether it be the British government or whether it be the American government, I would ask - do it now, please.

"And if you have the ability to put the pressure on the people who hold that key, do it now, please."

Ms Hall became the fourth US citizen to be released by the Taliban since January after talks between officials in Kabul - in what the group described as a "goodwill gesture" towards the Trump administration.

That prompted Mr Reynolds to appeal to US President Donald Trump directly to aid in Peter and Barbie's release, in a video taken outside the White House earlier this week.

Mr Reynolds, a US citizen, told BBC News that his parents had not been formally accused of any crime.

He said: "They've been in and out of court, which is infuriating for them because there's no charges and they are told every single time: yes, they are innocent, it's just a formality, we've made a mistake."

An Afghan interpreter was also arrested alongside the British couple.

Mr Reynolds said his parents had sought to work with the Taliban and had "been open" about their work in the country.

He said he believes his mother received "the only certificate for a woman to actually teach and train even men", despite women typically being banned from employment under Taliban rule.

"They deeply love the country," he added.
